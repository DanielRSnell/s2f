This advanced detection system analyzes vast amounts of data to identify patterns and anomalies associated with phishing attacks. It provides immediate alerts to users and administrators, allowing for swift action to prevent potential security breaches.\n\nAdditionally, we've introduced enhanced two-factor authentication (2FA) methods to strengthen account security. Users can now choose from multiple 2FA options, including:\n\n1. **Biometric Authentication**: Users can utilize fingerprint scanning, facial recognition, or voice recognition for a more secure and user-friendly authentication process.\n2. **Hardware Tokens**: Physical tokens that generate one-time passcodes, providing an additional layer of security that is not susceptible to phishing attacks.\n3. **Push Notifications**: Secure push notifications sent to a user’s registered mobile device, allowing for quick and easy approval of login attempts.\n4. **SMS and Email OTPs**: One-time passcodes sent via SMS or email, ensuring that even if one method is compromised, the account remains secure through another channel.\n\nThese features are designed to provide maximum security with minimal disruption to the user experience, ensuring that your sensitive information remains protected against the latest threats.\n\n**Bug Fixes:**\n\nWe have addressed several critical issues to enhance the stability and reliability of our security platform:\n\n1. **2FA Login Process**: Fixed an issue where the login process would sometimes fail when 2FA was enabled, particularly under conditions of high server load or network latency. This fix ensures a smoother and more reliable authentication experience for all users.\n2. **Performance Improvements**: Resolved performance issues that caused delays in threat detection notifications. These optimizations have reduced the latency between threat detection and alert generation, ensuring that administrators and users are informed of potential threats in real time.\n3. **Data Synchronization**: Fixed a bug where user data was not properly synchronized across different modules of the security system, which occasionally led to inconsistent user states and permissions.\n4. **User Interface Enhancements**: Improved the user interface to provide clearer instructions and feedback during the 2FA setup process, reducing the likelihood of user errors and improving overall satisfaction.\n5. **Compatibility Fixes**: Addressed compatibility issues with various browsers and operating systems to ensure that all users, regardless of their device or software, can utilize the full range of security features without encountering technical difficulties.\n6. **Logging and Reporting**: Enhanced logging mechanisms to provide more detailed and actionable insights into security events and system performance, aiding administrators in their efforts to monitor and respond to potential issues.\n7. **Error Handling**: Improved error handling to provide more informative messages and recovery options in the event of a failure, helping users to resolve issues quickly and efficiently without needing extensive technical support.\n\nThese updates are part of our ongoing commitment to providing the most secure, reliable, and user-friendly security solutions available. We continuously monitor and respond to feedback to ensure that our platform meets the evolving needs of our users and remains at the forefront of cybersecurity technology.\n",{title:536,short_title:537,image:538,date:539,version:540,content:541},"Real-Time Intrusion Detection System & User Activity Monitoring","Intrusion Detection & Activity Monitoring","/images/changelog/bg-2.svg","May 15, 2024","Version 4.4.0","##### Real-Time Intrusion Detection System & User Activity Monitoring\n\n**New Features:**\n\nImplemented a real-time intrusion detection system that alerts administrators of potential breaches instantly.
