#### Information We Collect

When you use Street2Fleet's scheduling software, we may collect certain information to provide and improve our services. This includes contact information you provide when setting up appointments, business information for service providers, and usage data to enhance our platform's functionality.

#### How We Use Your Information

We use the information collected to facilitate appointment scheduling between customers and home service businesses, send appointment confirmations and reminders via text message, integrate with CRM systems like ServiceTitan for seamless workflow management, and improve our scheduling platform's features and performance.

#### Protection of Personal Information

Street2Fleet takes the security of your personal information seriously. We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your data against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. Your information is stored securely and accessed only by authorized personnel who need it to provide our services.

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal information to third parties without your consent, except as necessary to provide our scheduling services or as required by law.

#### Data Sharing and Integration

Our platform integrates with CRM systems to streamline your workflow. When you connect Street2Fleet with your CRM (such as ServiceTitan), we share relevant appointment and customer information as needed to synchronize your scheduling data and maintain accurate records across platforms.

#### Privacy Policy Updates

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. We will notify users of any material changes by posting the updated policy on our website and, where appropriate, through other communication channels. Your continued use of our services after such updates constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
